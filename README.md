# head_Based_Interaction

An open-source project to study different ways of head-based interaction by implementing, combining and comparing several algorithms for Face Box Detection, Facial Landmark Localization, Head Pose and Head Gaze Calculation. The repository contains code snippets from the other open-source projects which are re-implemented here to provide full integration with this framework. 

The documentation will be updated soon.
